# AWS Serverless GenAI Deployment Strategies

This project demonstrates different deployment strategies for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) using AWS Serverless services. It showcases three distinct patterns for handling AI responses: WebSocket streaming, Server-Sent Events (SSE), and traditional REST APIs.

```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend (client/web)

- React/TypeScript application with real-time streaming UI
- Comparative metrics display for each strategy
- Unified interface for all three deployment strategies

### 2. Backend Services

#### WebSocket Strategy (services/realtime-ws)

- Bidirectional communication using API Gateway WebSocket APIs
- Real-time streaming of AI responses
- Connection management and error handling
- Metrics tracking for latency and tokens

#### SSE Strategy (services/stream-sse)

- One-way server-to-client streaming
- Lambda Function URLs for direct invocation
- Efficient for long-running AI responses
- Built-in retry mechanisms

#### REST Strategy (services/sync-api)

- Traditional request-response pattern
- API Gateway REST API integration
- Suitable for shorter, non-streaming responses

### 3. Infrastructure (infra/cdn)

- CloudFront distribution for content delivery
- S3 bucket for static asset hosting
- Route handling for all three strategies
- SSM Parameter Store for configuration

### 4. Shared Components (services/shared)

- Unified GenAI service implementation
- Amazon Bedrock integration
- Common types and utilities
- Error handling patterns

## Deployment Process

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account and configured AWS CLI
- Node.js (>= 16.x)
- AWS CDK v2 (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Make utility

### Bootstrap (First Time Only)

```bash
# Bootstrap CDK in your AWS account/region (run once)
make bootstrap
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. Deploy Everything

```bash
# Deploy all components (services, CDN, and frontend)
make deploy-all OWNER=your-name@company.com
```

#### 2. Deploy Individual Components

Deploy Backend Services:

```bash
# Deploy all backend services in parallel
make deploy-services OWNER=your-name@company.com

# Or deploy services individually:
make deploy-realtime-ws OWNER=your-name@company.com
make deploy-stream-sse OWNER=your-name@company.com
make deploy-sync-api OWNER=your-name@company.com
```

Deploy Infrastructure:

```bash
# Deploy CDN and S3 infrastructure
make deploy-cdn OWNER=your-name@company.com
```

Deploy Frontend:

```bash
# Deploy frontend application
make deploy-frontend
```

### Clean Up

```bash
# Clean all deployed resources
make clean-all
```

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Streaming**

   - Immediate response initiation
   - Token-by-token streaming
   - Progress tracking
   - Connection management

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - First chunk latency
   - Total response time
   - Token generation speed
   - Comparative analysis

## Cost Considerations

- Pay-per-request Lambda pricing
- API Gateway WebSocket connection minutes
- CloudFront data transfer
- S3 storage and requests
